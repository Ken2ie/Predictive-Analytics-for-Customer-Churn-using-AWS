# Project 1: Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn with AWS

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using AWS tools for handling big data.

## Steps and AWS Tools Used:

1. **Data Storage:** Store data in Amazon S3.
2. **Data Processing:** Use AWS Glue for ETL.
3. **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Utilize Amazon Athena and Amazon QuickSight.
4. **Machine Learning:** Build, train, and deploy the model with Amazon SageMaker.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the model as an API using Amazon SageMaker.

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Data Storage with Amazon S3:**
   - Upload your churn dataset to an S3 bucket using the AWS CLI.

2. **Data Processing with AWS Glue:**
   - Create an AWS Glue job to clean and preprocess the data.

3. **Data Exploration and Visualization:**
   - Query the data in S3 using Amazon Athena.
   - Visualize churn patterns with Amazon QuickSight.

4. **Machine Learning with Amazon SageMaker:**
   - Create a Jupyter notebook instance in SageMaker.
   - Use it to build and train the model.

5. **Deployment as an API:**
   - Deploy the trained model using SageMaker.
   - Utilize SageMaker endpoint for making predictions via an API.

## Summary

This project demonstrates the use of AWS services for handling big data and predictive analytics tasks. By following this workflow, you can efficiently manage, process, analyze, and model big data using AWS tools, making you a strong candidate for data science roles.
