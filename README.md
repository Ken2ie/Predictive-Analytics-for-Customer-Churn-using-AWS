# Customer Churn Prediction with Random Forest Classifier

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a customer churn prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier. Customer churn prediction is crucial for businesses aiming to retain customers. The workflow involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python libraries like pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Load the churn dataset.
- Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

### 2. Model Training
- Split the data into features (X) and the target variable (y).
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the Random Forest Classifier model.

### 3. Model Evaluation
- Make predictions on the test set.
- Evaluate the model's accuracy using metrics like accuracy_score.

## Project Summary
This project showcases the implementation of a customer churn prediction model using a Random Forest Classifier in Python. It emphasizes the importance of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation in building effective predictive models for business applications.
